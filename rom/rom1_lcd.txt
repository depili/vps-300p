LCD is driven by hitachi compatible S6A0069 chips, two chips in total. LCD is 4 lines by 40 characters.
First two rows are on controller 1, last two on controller 2. Both controllers share the RS bit and the
8 bit data bus.

The data bus is in rom1 PIO port A and the control lines are on PIO port B as follows:
bit     function
0       E for controller 1
1       E for controller 2
2       RS (common)
3       R/W? (this bit is always set to 0)
